- New nodes inserted in the tree with the exact same key (in this case polar angle), are possibly inserted after
  the already existing ones. In this case, they are in the wrong order. ConsecutiveRight and Left are now not
  working any more, as they compare the wrong edges!!! (frontier is not in the correct order any more!)
	- Possible fix (not good):
	  Implement a different data structure such as Skip Lists. With extra care on where elements are inserted,
          this might solve the issue.
	- Better fix:
	  Implement special case, where a vertex is directly hit (this is always the case when we have the exact 
	  same polar angle! Create two triangles now instead of one and there should never be two nodes with
	  the exact same polar angle in the frontier list anyway!!!
	- Reproduce the error:
	  testWave() with 15 points, newI *5.0 before DegToRad
- testWave() with lots of points is phenomenally slow! It spends up to 99% of overall runtime in legalizeTriangle()
  There needs to be some kind of fix or corner case so we don't reevaluate all the triangles again and again!
